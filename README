Inspiration Overload

This is the frontend of something I am working to display tons of visual art.  Sometimes I just need a lot of creative input when working on a project, or just to flush my mind and thoughts.  

The image links are stored in a sqlite database and retrieved using bottle.  The website is served with bottle (http://localhost:9999/inspiration), and retrieves the images links with bottle (http://localhost:9999/inspiration/data/:startID), and displays the returned JSON with some javascript.  
This is a draft, there are few things I want to work out.

*a better way to retrieve the images i.e. a better API for the database.  Maybe this will involve restructuring the database too. 

*a way to avoid repeat images

*a more elegant way to work that infinite scroll, i noticed it didnt work on the iPad.
